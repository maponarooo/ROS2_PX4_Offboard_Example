## Overview
This tutorial explains at a basic level how to use ROS2 and PX4 in order to control a simulated UAV's velocity with keyboard controls. The goal is to create a simple example that a complete beginner can follow and understand, even with no ROS2 or PX4 experience.

This repo is a derivative of Jaeyoung Lim's Offboard example

I've taken his example and added some functionality. 

## YouTube Tutorial
We published a walkthrough tutorial on YouTube to demonstrate the example and to help beginners set up their enviornment. The video is helpful, but be sure to always defer to this Readme file for instructions. Some changes have been made since the video was posted, meaning that though it is helpful, it is not 100% accurate.
